# Password_Generator

Hello!

The purpose of this project is to use javascript to create a working password generator (acceptance criteria below).

In order to complete this project, demonstration of several concepts in javascript were necessary. These include functions, arrays, if statements, loops ("for" statements), as well as Math.random functionality for selecting random indexes for four arrays needed to complete the project: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers.

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
